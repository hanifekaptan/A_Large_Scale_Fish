I have developed a comprehensive Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can accurately and reliably classify various fish species.

In my project, I trained on a large dataset collected from the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. This dataset:
* Black Sea Sprat
* Gilt-head Bream
* Horse Mackerel
* Red Mullet
* Red Sea Bream
* Sea Bass
* Shrimp
* Striped Red Mullet
* trout
It contains nine different marine creatures from different species.

The ANN model I developed was able to classify these species with **86%** accuracy. This result shows that the model can also work effectively in real-world applications.

**Tasks within the Scope of the Project**
1. Collection of fish dataset, exploratory analysis and visualizations, pre-processing
2. Designing and training multi-layer ANN architecture
3. Monitoring churn and accuracy metrics
4. Evaluating the model's performance on test data
5. Sharing the project in the GitHub repository and receiving relevant feedback

**Technologies and Tools**
1. Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
2. TensorFlow and Keras deep learning libraries
3. Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle, Git, GitHub
