I have developed a comprehensive Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can accurately and reliably classify various fish species.

In my project, I trained on a large dataset collected from the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. This dataset:
* Black Sea Sprat
* Gilt-head Bream
* Horse Mackerel
* Red Mullet
* Red Sea Bream
* Sea Bass
* Shrimp
* Striped Red Mullet
* trout
It contains nine different marine creatures from different species.

The ANN model I developed was able to classify these species with 86% accuracy. This result shows that the model can also work effectively in real-world applications.

Tasks within the Scope of the Project
1. Collection of fish dataset, exploratory analysis and visualizations, pre-processing
2. Designing and training multi-layer ANN architecture
3. Monitoring churn and accuracy metrics
4. Evaluating the model's performance on test data
5. Sharing the project in the GitHub repository and receiving relevant feedback

Technologies and Tools
1. Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
2. TensorFlow and Keras deep learning libraries
3. Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle, Git, GitHub
